### Momentum Frequency Distributions Analysis

The analysis of momentum frequency distributions (\(|M|\)) for electrons interacting with Aluminum, Gold, Iron, Plastic, and Uranium at energy levels of 1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, and 100,000 MeV reveals consistent patterns. At 1,000 MeV, peak frequencies for low momentum values are approximately 19,000 for Aluminum, 16,000 for Gold, 3,500 for Iron, and 3,000 for Plastic, indicating significant scattering and energy loss. At 10,000 MeV, peak frequencies remain high, around 21,000 for Aluminum and Gold, 4,000 for Iron, and 2,500 for Plastic. At 100,000 MeV, peak frequencies are about 25,000 for Aluminum and Gold, 5,000 for Iron, and 3,500 for Plastic. A secondary peak at maximum momentum values is noted, with frequencies around 2,500 for Aluminum and Gold at 1,000 MeV, 800 for Iron, and 120 for Plastic, increasing to approximately 1,000 at 100,000 MeV. This secondary peak becomes more pronounced at higher energy levels, indicating that a fraction of electrons retain a large portion of their initial momentum, suggesting less obstructive interactions. The consistent patterns across different materials suggest a universal interaction mechanism, with material-specific variations primarily affecting the frequency of low momentum values due to scattering effects.

### Muon Momentum Retention

The histograms depicting the interactions of positively charged muons with various materials (Aluminum, Gold, Iron, Plastic, and Uranium) at energy levels of 1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, and 100,000 MeV show that muons predominantly retain their initial momentum. At 1,000 MeV, peak frequencies are approximately 1,200 for Aluminum, Gold, Iron, and Uranium, and 200 for Plastic. At 10,000 MeV, peak frequencies are around 1,200 for all materials. At 100,000 MeV, the peak frequencies remain near 1,200 for all materials. The slight variations in frequency spread suggest minimal momentum change during interactions, with metals showing sharper peaks compared to the broader distribution in Plastic. These results indicate that muons maintain their momentum across different materials and energy levels, highlighting their robustness for experimental and material science applications.

### Muon Interaction Patterns

The provided graphs illustrate a consistent pattern in the momentum distribution of negatively charged muons (\(\mu^-\)) interacting with various materials (Aluminum, Gold, Iron, Plastic, Uranium) at energy levels of 1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, and 100,000 MeV. Each graph shows two distinct peaks: one at low momentum values (0-50 MeV/c) and another at high momentum values corresponding to the initial energy levels (1,000 MeV/c, 10,000 MeV/c, 100,000 MeV/c). For example, in the Aluminum graphs, the low momentum peak frequency is approximately 4,000-5,000 for 1,000 MeV, 6,000-7,000 for 10,000 MeV, and 6,000-7,000 for 100,000 MeV. In Gold, the low momentum peak frequency is around 1,200-1,300 across all energy levels. The high momentum peaks consistently show frequencies of 12,000-13,000, indicating muons that retain their initial energy. This pattern demonstrates the similar interaction mechanisms of muons with different materials, highlighting both rapid energy loss and energy retention behaviors.

### Proton Momentum Distribution

The analysis of the provided graphs, illustrating the frequency variation as a function of momentum for protons interacting with different materials (Aluminum, Gold, Iron, Plastic, Uranium) at energy levels of 1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, and 100,000 MeV, reveals several key findings. Across all materials, the frequency distributions consistently show two main peaks: one near zero and another at the maximum momentum value. For example, in Aluminum at 1,000 MeV, the frequencies at the low and high momentum peaks are approximately 600 and 1,200, respectively. This pattern remains consistent at higher energy levels, with frequencies at 100,000 MeV increasing to around 5,000 and 12,000. Similarly, in Gold at 10,000 MeV, the peak frequencies are about 400 and 1,200, and in Uranium, the peaks show frequencies of roughly 400 and 1,200 at the same energy level. The data indicate that higher energy levels result in a broader momentum distribution and an increase in the frequency of high momentum values, suggesting more protons retain higher momenta after interaction. While the overall distribution shape is consistent across materials, the relative frequencies vary, reflecting the influence of material properties on interaction dynamics. For instance, the high momentum peak frequency for Plastic at 1,000 MeV is around 300, lower than metals, indicating different interaction characteristics likely due to its lower atomic number. These observations underscore the significant impact of both energy levels and material properties on proton interaction dynamics.
