### Summary of Findings

#### Electrons
- **Momentum Frequency Patterns**: 
  - Consistent across materials at different energy levels (1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, 100,000 MeV).
  - Peak frequencies for low momentum values indicate significant scattering and energy loss.
  - Secondary peaks at maximum momentum values, becoming more pronounced at higher energies, suggesting some electrons retain initial momentum.

#### Positively Charged Muons
- **Momentum Retention**:
  - Predominantly retain initial momentum across different materials and energy levels.
  - Minimal change in frequency spread, with sharper peaks in metals compared to broader distribution in Plastic.
  - Demonstrates robustness for experimental and material science applications.

#### Negatively Charged Muons (\(\mu^-\))
- **Interaction Patterns**:
  - Two distinct peaks: one at low momentum values and another at high momentum values.
  - Consistent pattern across different materials and energy levels.
  - Indicates similar interaction mechanisms with rapid energy loss and energy retention behaviors.

#### Protons
- **Momentum Distribution**:
  - Consistent frequency distributions showing two main peaks: near zero and at maximum momentum.
  - Higher energy levels result in broader momentum distribution and increased high momentum frequencies.
  - Reflects material properties' influence on interaction dynamics, with lower frequencies in Plastic indicating different characteristics due to its lower atomic number.

Overall, the findings highlight consistent interaction patterns across different materials and energy levels, with variations primarily influenced by material properties. This indicates universal interaction mechanisms with specific material-dependent effects on scattering and momentum retention.
