### Summary of Findings

**Electron Interactions:**
- All materials (Aluminum, Gold, Iron, Plastic, Uranium) show a consistent peak in particle count at a radius of 500 units.
- Particle counts increase with energy levels (1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, 100,000 MeV).
- Aluminum: Peaks at 35,000 (1,000 MeV), 40,000 (10,000 MeV), remains significant at 100,000 MeV.
- Gold, Iron, Plastic: Peaks around 6,000 (1,000 MeV), increasing to 35,000-40,000 at higher energies.
- Uranium: Peaks at 6,000 (1,000 MeV), 35,000 (10,000 MeV), 350,000 (100,000 MeV).

**Positively Charged Muon Interactions:**
- Consistent peak at a radius of 500 units across all materials.
- Particle counts at 1,000 MeV: Aluminum (~10,000), Gold/Iron (~1,000), Uranium (~1,400), Plastic (~700).
- Heavier materials (Gold, Iron, Uranium) show broader distributions, reflecting higher interaction rates.
- Patterns remain consistent across different energy levels, indicating material properties govern interactions.

**Negatively Charged Muon Interactions:**
- Consistent peak at a radius of 500 units across all materials and energy levels.
- Particle counts at 1,000 MeV: Aluminum (~10,000), Gold (~2,000), Iron/Plastic/Uranium (1,000-10,000).
- Low particle counts (below 500) in the 480-497.5 radius range.
- Indicates a boundary effect with a common interaction mechanism at the 500 radius mark.

**Proton Interactions:**
- Consistent peak in particle counts at a radius of 500 units for Aluminum and Gold.
- Aluminum: Peak count of ~10,000 at 1,000 MeV, increasing with energy.
- Gold: Peak count of ~3,500 at 1,000 MeV, increasing at higher energies.
- Suggests significant edge effects or boundary scattering with higher energies increasing interactions without altering distribution patterns.
