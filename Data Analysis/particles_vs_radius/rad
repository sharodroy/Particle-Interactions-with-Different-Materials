### Electron Interactions with Various Materials

The electron interactions with Aluminum, Gold, Iron, Plastic, and Uranium at energy levels of 1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, and 100,000 MeV consistently show a peak in particle count at approximately 500 units. For Aluminum at 1,000 MeV, the peak particle count is around 35,000, increasing to 40,000 at 10,000 MeV and remaining significant at 100,000 MeV. Gold shows a peak particle count of 6,000 at 1,000 MeV, rising to 35,000 at 10,000 MeV and 40,000 at 100,000 MeV. Iron follows a similar trend with a peak of 6,000 particles at 1,000 MeV, increasing to 35,000 at 10,000 MeV and reaching 40,000 at 100,000 MeV. For Plastic, the peak counts are 6,000, 35,000, and 40,000 for 1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, and 100,000 MeV, respectively. Uranium exhibits the highest peak counts, with 6,000 at 1,000 MeV, 35,000 at 10,000 MeV, and an exceptional 350,000 at 100,000 MeV. These findings suggest a critical particle concentration at a radius of 500, with particle counts increasing significantly with higher energy levels across all materials.

### Positively Charged Muon Interactions

Histograms of positively charged muons (\(\mu^+\)) interacting with Aluminum, Gold, Iron, Plastic, and Uranium at energy levels of 1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, and 100,000 MeV reveal consistent peaks at a radius of 500 units. At 1,000 MeV, the counts are ~10,000 for Aluminum, ~1,000 for Gold and Iron, ~1,400 for Uranium, and ~700 for Plastic. Heavier materials exhibit broader distributions at lower radii, reflecting higher interaction rates. For instance, at 10,000 MeV, Iron has approximately 1,200 particles at the 500-unit radius with a noticeable spread between 480-490 units, whereas Aluminum shows a sharper peak with fewer particles below 485 units. This indicates higher interaction cross-sections for heavier materials, leading to increased scattering and absorption events compared to lighter materials. The distribution patterns remain largely consistent across energy levels, suggesting material properties primarily govern interaction dynamics.

### Negatively Charged Muon Interactions

Histograms of negatively charged muons interacting with Aluminum, Gold, Iron, Plastic, and Uranium at energy levels of 1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, and 100,000 MeV consistently show a peak at a radius of 500 units. For Aluminum at 1,000 MeV, the particle count at this radius is approximately 10,000, a pattern also observed at 10,000 MeV and 100,000 MeV. Gold shows a peak of about 2,000 particles at 1,000 MeV, increasing to around 10,000 at higher energy levels. Iron, Plastic, and Uranium show similar trends, with peaks ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 particles at a radius of 500 across all energy levels. Particle counts in the 480-497.5 radius range remain low, generally below 500 particles, regardless of material or energy level. This consistent pattern suggests a boundary effect, indicating muons are predominantly detected at the 500 radius mark due to a common interaction mechanism with these materials or a characteristic of the experimental setup.

### Proton Interactions

Histograms of protons interacting with Aluminum and Gold at 1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, and 100,000 MeV show a consistent peak in particle counts at a radius of 500 units. For Aluminum at 1,000 MeV, the count at this radius reaches approximately 10,000, with minimal counts at other radii. This pattern persists at 10,000 MeV and 100,000 MeV, though overall particle numbers increase. Gold exhibits similar behavior, with counts around 3,500 at 1,000 MeV, rising at higher energies while maintaining the peak at 500 units. These results suggest significant edge effects or boundary scattering, with higher proton energies leading to increased particle interactions without altering the distribution pattern.
