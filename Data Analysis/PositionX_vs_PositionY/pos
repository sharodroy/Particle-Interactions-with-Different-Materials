**Electron Scattering Patterns Across Materials and Energies**

The scatter plots of electron positions interacting with various materials at different energy levels reveal distinct trends. At 1,000 MeV, electrons are tightly clustered within ±2 units on both axes, with Aluminum showing a confined spread from -2 to 2 for both PositionX and PositionY. At 10,000 MeV, the spread increases to -4 to 4, indicating greater scattering. This pattern is consistent across materials like Gold and Iron. At 100,000 MeV, the dispersion further broadens, with electrons spread between -5 and 5. Metals like Aluminum, Gold, and Iron maintain high central densities even at 100,000 MeV, whereas Plastic and Uranium show slightly different scatter patterns. Plastic displays less spread at lower energies but aligns more with metals at higher energies. These findings indicate that higher energy electrons result in broader and more dispersed distributions, which is crucial for understanding material interactions and electron behavior.

**Positively Charged Muon Interactions**

Scatter plots of positively charged muons interacting with different materials at energy levels of 1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, and 100,000 MeV show an increasing spread in PositionX and PositionY with rising energy levels across all materials. In Aluminum, the muon spread at 1,000 MeV is within ±2 units, expanding to approximately ±4 units at 100,000 MeV. Denser materials such as Gold and Uranium exhibit muon spreads within ±1 unit at 1,000 MeV, indicating strong interaction and absorption. At 100,000 MeV, the spread extends to about ±3 units in Gold and ±4 units in Uranium. In lighter materials like Plastic, the spread increases from ±2 units at 1,000 MeV to about ±4 units at 100,000 MeV. These findings highlight the greater penetration and scattering of higher energy muons, with denser materials exhibiting stronger absorption at lower energies but similar scattering at higher energies. This data is critical for applications in radiation shielding and particle physics experiments.

**Negatively Charged Muon Interactions**

Scatter plots of negatively charged muons interacting with different materials at varying energy levels exhibit distinct patterns in their spatial distribution. For Aluminum, at 1,000 MeV, the spread of data points is within ±3 units on both PositionX and PositionY axes. At 10,000 MeV, this spread increases to about ±4 units, and at 100,000 MeV, it extends to around ±5 units, indicating deeper penetration and more extensive scattering with increasing energy. For Gold, the spread is smaller at lower energies, within ±2 units at 1,000 MeV, extending to ±3 units at 10,000 MeV, and about ±4 units at 100,000 MeV, reflecting its higher density and greater scattering and absorption of muons. Similar trends are observed for Iron, with spreads of ±2.5 units, ±3.5 units, and ±4.5 units at 1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, and 100,000 MeV, respectively. In contrast, Plastic, being less dense, exhibits a wider spread even at lower energies, ranging from ±3 units at 1,000 MeV to about ±5 units at 100,000 MeV. Uranium, the densest material, shows the smallest spread at low energy levels (within ±1.5 units at 1,000 MeV) but extends to about ±3 units at 10,000 MeV and ±4 units at 100,000 MeV. These observations highlight how material density and muon energy influence scattering and penetration, with denser materials like Gold and Uranium causing more significant scattering at lower energies, and higher energy muons penetrating deeper and scattering more extensively across all materials.

**Proton Interaction Analysis**

The scatter plots illustrate the impact of protons on different materials (Aluminum, Gold, Iron, Plastic, Uranium) at energy levels of 1,000 MeV, 10,000 MeV, and 100,000 MeV. At 1,000 MeV, Aluminum shows a spread with most impacts within ±2 units on both axes, expanding to ±5 units at 100,000 MeV, indicating increased scattering with higher energy. Gold has a tight cluster within ±1 unit at 1,000 MeV due to its high stopping power, spreading to ±4 units at 100,000 MeV. Iron exhibits a uniform distribution, with impacts within ±3 units at 1,000 MeV and extending to ±5 units at 100,000 MeV. Plastic shows the broadest spread, from ±3 units at 1,000 MeV to ±5 units at 100,000 MeV, indicating less resistance to proton penetration. Uranium, similar to Gold, shows a tight cluster within ±1 unit at 1,000 MeV, spreading to ±4 units at 100,000 MeV. These results indicate that higher proton energies lead to increased scattering across all materials, with heavier materials like Gold and Uranium showing denser central clusters, reflecting their higher stopping power compared to lighter materials like Plastic.
